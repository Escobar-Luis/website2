            <h2>As the title suggest's, this is my 2nd attempt at creating my personal website. <strong>Why?</strong></h2>
            <h3>Well, in my <a href="https://escobar-luis.github.io/Website/">first website</a>, 
                I used the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs">free code camp</a> 
                walkthrough on building a website for my portfolio.
            </h3>
            <h3>The reason being that I wanted to see how a professional who's been coding for years constructs a website so,
                I can get first hand experience. Lo and Behold, I was extremely overwhelmed! 
                I was following along well through the html portion until we reached the css.
            </h3>
            <h3><strong>OMG!</strong>The amount of styling that guy used was unbelievable; I couldn't keep up.
                However, from the experience, I was able to retain the good practice of classifying all my divs
                so they can be styled more easily with css. As well, learned how to organize my html in a human readble fashion!
