                As the title suggest's, this is my 2nd attempt at creating my personal website. <strong>Why?</strong>
                </h4>
                <h4>
                Well, in my <a href="https://escobar-luis.github.io/Website/">first website</a>, 
                I used the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs">free code camp</a> 
                walkthrough on building a website for my portfolio.
                </h4>
                <h4>The reason being that I wanted to see how a professional who's been coding for years constructs a website so,
                I can get first hand experience. Lo and Behold, I was extremely overwhelmed! 
                I was following along well through the html portion until we reached the css.
                </h4>
                <h4><strong>OMG!</strong> The amount of styling that guy used was unbelievable; I couldn't keep up.
                However, from the experience, I was able to retain the good practice of classifying all my divs
                so they can be styled more easily with css. As well, learned how to organize my html in a human readble fashion!
                </h4>
                <h4>
                Anyways, I didn't feel comfortable of leaving that first website since it wasn't a display of my "True" skill but, of an experienced developer. 
                It's similar to the guilty feeling we get (at least I did), of copying someones homework and handing it as your own.  
                So I re-did it and this website is a display of my current skill and I know its bad! Lol
